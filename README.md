## Basic Todo application

although is project is most created among begineers,even though i thought to build this application using react
Currently i am learning react 
(completed till Hooks)

### Ideas for Future updates
1. create a checkbox (if checked then task is  done then strike the txt)
2. add deadline 
3. change the list acc to the time(if new day comes,old list is updated into empty and if their are any deadline then that particular todo is added into the new list)
4. updated a better UI

I'm always looking for ways to improve the application, so if you have any suggestions for new features, please feel free to submit a pull request for review. I'd love to hear your ideas!
